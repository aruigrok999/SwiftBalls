Ideas:
Let source be obstacle
Let the user add more than lines
Let the user pick a note for random shapes, or do it based on size
Let the user draw shapes with the pencil
Make the source look like a chute

Bugs:
Add an icon
We should keep the canvas the same size on rotation; Probably don't rotate the canvas, just the UI
Pause before it starts dropping so it looks like it rolls out of the source
