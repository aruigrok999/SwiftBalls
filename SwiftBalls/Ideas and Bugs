Ideas:
Let source be obstacle
Let the user add more than lines
Let the user pick a note for random shapes, or do it based on size
Let the user draw shapes with the pencil

Bugs:
We should keep the canvas the same size on rotation;
    keep it square and size of length of device
Pause before it starts dropping so it looks like it rolls out of the source
Make the source look like a chute
Let the pitch of the device determine gravity, like the ball is rolling on the surface
