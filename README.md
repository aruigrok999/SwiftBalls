# SwiftBalls
A simple little game that lets you create musical notes with falling balls

Drag on the canvas to create lines
Drag around the source circle to move it
Drag the endpoints of the line to move them. Make them very small to delete them.

Responds to the orientation and accelerometer on the iPhone and iPad.
Note that the volume of the notes is controlled by ringer volume.

This project shows the use of SpriteKit in Swift

This is the first of many projects I plan to publish to the App Store to show my technical ability.
